# Lung Cancer Detection  

**Deep Learning-Based Lung Cancer Classification from Medical Images**  

## Overview  

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection significantly increases survival rates. **Lung Cancer Detection** is a deep learning model designed to classify lung scans and identify potential cancerous regions. Using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, this system helps in medical image analysis, assisting radiologists and healthcare professionals.  

## Technologies Used  

- **Frameworks & Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV  
- **Deep Learning Model:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Image Processing:** OpenCV, PIL  

## Setup
