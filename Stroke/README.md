# Stroke Prediction  

**Stroke Prediction Using Deep Learning**   

## Overview  
This project implements a **deep learning-based stroke prediction model** to classify whether a person is at risk of having a stroke. The model is built using **TensorFlow/Keras** and trained on health and demographic data.  

## Features 
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Data preprocessing including categorical encoding and normalization.
- Handling class imbalance using SMOTE.
- Deep Learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras.
- Model training with early stopping to prevent overfitting.

## Model Architecture

The model consists of:

    Input Layer: 14 neurons with ReLU activation.
    Hidden Layers:
        7 neurons with ReLU activation.
        3 neurons with ReLU activation.
    Output Layer: 1 neuron with Sigmoid activation (Binary Classification).

## Training and Optimization
- Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy.
- Optimizer: Adam.
- Batch Size: 16.
- Early Stopping: Stops training if validation loss doesn't improve for 17 epochs.
